Descriptions
This course demystifies the internal working of the Microcontroller and its Peripherals by coding step by step and developing software drivers entirely from scratch extracting maximum information from Datasheets, Reference manuals, Specs, etc. Also protocol decoding using logic analyzers debugging, testing along with hints and tips. Will write peripheral drivers for most commonly used peripherals such as GPIOs, I2C, SPI, USART, etc., from scratch.
